# WalkerBot
small and cute walking robot

This repository contains all of the files necessary to print, assemble, and run the WalkerBot. It uses an Arduino Micro as the control board, which the code will run on. Users will likely need to install the Leg.h and Leg.cpp files in their Libraries for the Arduino IDE to recognize them as valid (to do so, create a new subfolder of Libraries called Leg and copy the code in).
